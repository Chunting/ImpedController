Cartesian impedance controller for pr2 developed during my visit in UTS. It follows the principal idea of impedance control of hogan. I borrowed lot from the paper "Ficuciello F, Romano A, Villani L, et al. Cartesian impedance control of redundant manipulators for human-robot co-manipulation[C]//Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2014), 2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on. IEEE, 2014: 2120-2125."
